# Arduino Fish Feeder V2.O

This repository contains the code and circuit diagram for an automated fish feeder powered by Arduino. The feeder dispenses a preset amount of fish food into an aquarium at customizable intervals. Users can adjust the feeding interval and food quantity via software and hardware controls.

## Features

- **Automated Feeding**: Automatically dispenses fish food at user-defined intervals.
- **Customizable Feeding Interval**: Adjust the feeding duration easily by modifying the code.
- **Manual Food Quantity Adjustment**: Set the amount of food using a mechanical slider or servo-based mechanism.

## Contents

- **`circuit.png`**: A schematic for assembling the feeder circuit.
- **`code.ino`**: The Arduino code to control the feeder mechanism.

## How It Works

1. The Arduino board controls a servo motor or stepper motor for dispensing food.  
2. The default feeding interval is set to 4 minutes.
3. Food quantity is manually adjusted via a mechanical slider or a servo-based adjustable gate.

## Future Development Plans

### **IoT Control**
- Enable remote configuration of feeding intervals and food quantities via a web or mobile app.
- Push notifications for feeding events and low food levels.
- Cloud-based storage of feeding logs.

### **Live Video Feed**
- Integrate a camera module for real-time aquarium monitoring.
- Add a web interface for remote viewing.
